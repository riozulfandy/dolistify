## Lesson Learned
This is my third project in creating applications using the Flutter framework. The two previous projects were related to the PBP course, involving both individual and group assignments. However, working on this project introduced me to several new aspects of application development. I learned how to integrate data within the application with local storage, and I also focused on writing clean code for analysis in the CI/CD process. Implementing CI/CD during the development of this application was a new learning experience for me. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I couldn't automate testing for the application. I encountered and learned a lot from various bugs during the development process. However, the current state of the application is not perfect as per my plan, specifically due to challenges with the smooth functioning of the notification feature.
